Speech Emotion Recognition & Data Sonification

Competed by Gustavo Colmeman & Sebastian Bayne as a final project for WBS Coding School’s ‘Data Science’ course. Both have a background in audio and wanted to work with sound data techniques. 

This is a two-part project, firstly building a ‘Speech Emotion Recognition’ model using Deep Learning, and secondly to exploring the possibilities of ‘Data Sonification’. 

The back story is that we work for a fictitious telco company ‘VolaPhone’, and we are given audio data and numerical and categorical data extracted from the Customer Service calls and our mission is to look at ways we can improve customer service KPIs with historical data.
